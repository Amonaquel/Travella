# ✈️ Travella

Travella is a full-stack web application that aims to simplify the travel planning process for users by offering a platform where they can explore destinations, build detailed travel itineraries, and manage trip information — all in one place.

The project is designed for individuals, families, and groups who want to streamline their travel experience with an intuitive and interactive interface. Users can log in to their accounts, browse curated destinations, and use tools like maps and customizable day planners to organize each aspect of their journey.

Unlike traditional travel sites, Travella focuses on **user flexibility and trip visualization**, allowing people to plan not just *where* to go, but *how* they will spend their time once there. Whether it's booking a museum tour, allocating free time for relaxation, or grouping sightseeing spots by proximity, Travella provides the structure and tools to support efficient planning.

The frontend provides a responsive and modern interface built using React, while the backend API — built on Node.js and Express — handles user management, itinerary storage, and destination data. MongoDB serves as the database layer, offering scalable and flexible document-based storage.
